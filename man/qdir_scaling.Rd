\title{Directional quantile scaling.}
\usage{
qdir_scaling(curve_set, probs = c(0.025, 0.975), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{curve_set}{A curve_set or an \code{\link[spatstat]{envelope}}
object. If an envelope object is given, it must contain the summary
functions from the simulated patterns which can be achieved by setting
savefuns = TRUE when calling envelope().}

\item{probs}{A two-element vector containing the lower and upper
quantiles for the envelope, in that order and on the interval [0, 1].
The default values are 0.025 and 0.975 as in the article by MÃ¸ller and
Berthelsen (2012).}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to quantile.}
}
\value{
A scaled curve_set.
}
\description{
Directional quantile scaling.
}
\details{
Notice that this scaling is only defined for residuals.
