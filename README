Spatial point process testing

spptest provides envelope and deviation tests for spatial point processes.
The main motivation for a new package are the power-correcting scalings for
deviation tests, new deviation measures and new envelope tests.

The user might need to only know about the functions random_labelling_test
and scaled_deviation_test. The first tests the random labelling hypothesis
for the given point pattern and returns the p-value. The latter function
takes already calculated summary function curves (for example an envelope
object from spatstat) and returns a p-value.

If your summary function curves are in a different format than an envelope
object from spatstat or the curve_set of this package, you can use
create_curve_set after converting your data into the appropriate form. The
object structure is described in the manual for create_curve_set.

To calculate a summary function from a point pattern, use the function
estimate_K_f or estimate_L_f.
