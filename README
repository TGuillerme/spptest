Spatial point process testing

spptest provides envelope and deviation tests for spatial point processes.
The main motivation for a new package are the scalings for deviation tests
and global envelope tests.

To start: install the library, load it to R and see help(spptest). This main
help page describes the usage of the functions of the library.

In order to use the function random_labeling, the R library 'marksummary' is
needed.
